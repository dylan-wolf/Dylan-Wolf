### Bienvenue, 

Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics at night while working during the day as a data scientist. I have studied computer science and mathematics for more than six years as a student, tutor, and autodidact.

I am currently learning about mathematical modeling methods, data science, and machine learning.
