### Bienvenue, 

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Mathematics at night while working during the day as a technical writer and frontend developer. I am interested in mathematical climate modeling with a focus on atmospheric modeling.  I have studied computer science for more than six years as a student, tutor, and autodidact.

I am currently learning about mathematical modeling methods, atmospheric physics, and geophysical fluid dynamics.
